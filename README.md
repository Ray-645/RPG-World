# RPG-World (Basic's and Concepts)

Welcome to the RPG World repository where the goal is to eventually make a text base RPG Game bit by bit.

Context: *I'm new to Python and I'm learning bit by bit. This may not be the most complex RPG Game but I want it to be something I'm proud of.*

## Current Goal

- Level_Test.py         **[In Progress]** - Started a basic story.
- Battle_Test.py        **[In Progress]** -  I made some progress but Im putting a pause in order to focus on Level Test.
- Random_Encounter.py   **[Backlog]**
- [Full_Game].py        **[Backlog]**
