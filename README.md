# RPG-World (Basic's and Concepts)

Welcome to the RPG World repository where the goal is to eventually make a text base RPG Game bit by bit.

Located in the .Concepts folder is the work on the basics of Python and where most of my progress will be documented. Once I have more experience I will start actually making the game.
